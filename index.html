    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="update-date">Effective date: 2025-05-15</div>

    <p>Hello! My name is Ivailo Stoianov, and I am the sole developer and operator of Rant2note ("the Application"). This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, and protect your information when you use my app. By using Rant2note, you agree to the practices described below.</p>

    <h2>1. Information I Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Voice Recordings:</strong> When you use Rant2note, you can record your voice. These recordings are processed to generate text notes using AI-powered transcription and summarization.</li>
      <li><strong>Transcription & AI Data:</strong> The audio you record is sent securely to my servers and/or trusted third-party AI providers for transcription and note generation. The resulting text is stored in your account for your access.</li>
      <li><strong>Device & Usage Data:</strong> I may collect information such as your device's IP address, operating system, app version, usage statistics (e.g., which features you use, session duration), and crash logs to improve the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> If you create an account, I may collect your email address and a user ID.</li>
      <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> I do not collect precise location data. General location (country/city) may be inferred from your IP address for analytics and security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How I Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and improve the core functionality of Rant2note, including voice-to-note conversion.</li>
      <li>To personalize your experience and offer relevant features.</li>
      <li>To analyze usage and improve app performance.</li>
      <li>To communicate with you about updates, support, or marketing (if you opt in).</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations and protect my rights and users' safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Voice Data & AI Processing</h2>
    <p>Your voice recordings are used solely to generate text notes for you. Audio files and transcriptions may be temporarily stored on secure servers for processing. I use trusted third-party AI services (such as Google Cloud, OpenAI, or similar) for transcription and summarization. These providers process your data only as needed to provide the service and are contractually obligated to protect your privacy.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>I use third-party services for analytics, crash reporting, and in-app purchases. These may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueCat</a></li>
      <li>AI/ML providers (e.g., Google Cloud, OpenAI) for voice transcription and note generation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services have their own privacy policies. I share only the minimum data necessary and require all partners to protect your information.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>I use industry-standard security measures to protect your data, including encryption in transit and at rest, access controls, and regular security reviews. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>I retain your data as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the service. You can request deletion of your data at any time by contacting me.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can request a copy of your data.</li>
      <li><strong>Correction:</strong> You can request corrections to your data.</li>
      <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can request deletion of your account and data.</li>
      <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You can stop all data collection by uninstalling the app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact me at <a href="mailto:stivailo05@gmail.com">stivailo05@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Rant2note is not intended for children under 13. I do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If I learn that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I will delete it promptly. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided me with personal information, please contact me.</p>

    <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be processed and stored on servers located outside your country. I take steps to ensure your data is protected according to this policy and applicable laws.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you of significant changes by updating this page. Please review this policy regularly.</p>

    <h2>11. Contact Me</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact me at <a href="mailto:stivailo05@gmail.com">stivailo05@gmail.com</a>.</p>
